In CFD, we discretize the governing equations over a grid of points in the fluid domain. There are several methods of discretization, but we will focus on two main ones:\n",

The basic idea is to approximate the derivatives in the equations by the differences at the discrete points. For example, the first derivative of a function can be approximated by the difference between its values at two adjacent points, divided by the distance between the points.\n",

It involves dividing the domain into a finite number of control volumes and integrating the governing equations over these volumes. The FV method is particularly useful for problems involving complex geometries and conservation laws, as it ensures the conservation of quantities like mass and energy at the control volumes.\n",
